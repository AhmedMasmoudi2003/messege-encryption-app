# messege-encryption-app
an old project i did while i was learning python in high school.
you basically enter a message and click encription and it will change, you send it to your freind, your freind take the messege, put it in the app and click decryption and he gets the real message.

i also converted the python project to executable(.py --> .exe) and created a setup file to make ot easier to download and to learn making a real app..
